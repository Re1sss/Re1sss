- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Re1sss
- im 17
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in card games, coding random util classes for hours no break then forgetting they existed rince repeat
-  imma planning to make a new visual language that compiles down to regular code of some format in order to make prototyping easier
-  i migth be a nerd !!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning new stuff to improve myself
- I lack basic motor functions and reflexes
- Im kinda lost lately i have no idea what i want to or am going to do
- my mind is slowly turning into a mess of information and emotions (emotions which are meaningless like the hormons flow in my blood but i dont feel anything special or meaningful about it)
- about lessons im good at maths and only maths (im mega screwed, im basically three years behind at everything else)
